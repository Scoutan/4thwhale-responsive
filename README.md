<h1>4th Whale Responsive Layout Test.</h1>

<h3>1st approach - Flexbox</h3>
<p>
  My initial approach was to use flexbox, as I was not too knowledgeable about Responsive Web Design (RWD) in theory. I knew I was in a bad spot once I had the desktop layout completed and had to scale down the contents all the way to iPhone 8's 375px width. I pressed on just for the heck of it to see how it would turn out. I would say using flexbox for such layout made it way more complicated than it should be.

  Though it made me go through documentations about RWD, notably from Mozilla, where I learned that flexbox is ideally used for 1 dimensional layouts and grid for 2 dimensional layouts.

<h3>2nd approach - Grid & Mobile First<h3>
<p>
  Knowing that CSS grid should have been used, I decided to build a grid version of my CSS code and apply the Mobile First approach. The end result was that it took significantly less time, cleaner code, and better looking, true to original design responsive layouts as we resize from wide desktop viewports to narrow mobile viewports.
